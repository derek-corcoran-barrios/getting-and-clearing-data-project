# getting-and-clearing-data-project
This repository contains three files:
* README.md
* Codebook.md
* run_analysis.R


The *README.md* file that you are reading which explains the relationship between the three files and how to run the run_analysis.R script in R.

The *Codebook.md* explains the variables used in this repository

The *run_analysis.R* has the script to get the tidy dataset in r and export it into a txt. file.
From the first to the second anotation of the script it shows how to upload the needed files into R, in order to do that you have to download the dataset available as a zip in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and unzip all files into a folder in your R working directory called *Proyecto data cleaning* in my case my working directory is *Rcoursera* if the name of your WD is diferent you have to change it acordingly prior to reading the data into R.
After that you just run the rest of the script and you will get a tidy dataset in R called *melt.database3* and an exported txt file in your WD called *excersice5.txt*
